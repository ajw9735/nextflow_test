INSTRUCTIONS:

After logging onto your Greene account and entering into an approproate scratch directory run this command:

cp /scratch/ajw9735/nf_fastp_bwa .

Then enter the directory:

cd nf_fastp_bwa

From the directory import nextflow:

module load nextflow/21.10.6

Then run this command to see options:

nextflow run script.nf --help

Then you can run this command to execute the script, changing the username:

sbatch nextflow run script.nf --usrname name@nyu.edu

Results will show up for each process in the results-dir directory, with the final 3 bam files in the sort_results subdirectory.

NOTE: I use DSL2 in which channels between processes are implicit, I initialized 1 channel, but I think there should technically be 3 though I don't explicitly define them.
Also if there is an issue with the first cp command (like some permissions that I am unaware of) apologies. :fingers_crossed

P.S. Thanks! And would really appreciate feedback, I will likely be using nextflow for a project I am doing this summer and I'm sure my submission could use 
a lot of improvement (if it does not throw errors as is) and considering there are not a ton of guides online, any feedback really would be utilized.
